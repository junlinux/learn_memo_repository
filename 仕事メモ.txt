Mr. Roth, I really appreciate your help.
I'm sorry for replying to you so late.
But when I used the FastTest library test, 
it got a same value in P@1 and R@1 (as default),
as shown in the picture below.

I also tried to test the date classified as two classes, 
but P@1 always equal to R@1.
When I calcuated the value of P@2 and R@2,
I got P@2=50% and R@2=100%, 
but I thank it shoud be P@2=100% and R@2=100%.

So I really want to know the formula on P@1, P@2 and P@3.

Thanks very much for your help
